# RAG-Driven-Chatbot
This web application leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combined with locally hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver precise, contextually relevant responses based on uploaded PDF documents. Built with Streamlit for an interactive interface, it employs FAISS for efficient information retrieval and Ollama for seamless local LLM integration.
